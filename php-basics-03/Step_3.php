<!-- Using while loop write a programme that count number of times a word present in a sentence.
The programme should take as argument the text and the word to be searched for
Hint use `explode(" ", $text); // explode function looks for " " and creates an array, where each word is an element of the array
Hint use count function to get the number of iterations/repetitions -->
<!-- <?php
